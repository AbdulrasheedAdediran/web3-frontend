Nft staking contract
This project is the frontend implementation of a staking contract that allows a users stake ERC20 tokens and get 10% of their stake monthly.
For users to get access to stake, they have to hold at least one unit of a paticular ERC7211 NFT.

And  holding the NFT gives them the access to stake,
The staking contract allows users to stake nft and get an ERC 20 token and gain 10% rewards on th token after 30 days but can only withdraw with rewards after 3days of staking. But if users withdraws before 3days they only get the exact value of their tokens.
